DeeperTruth is an advanced real-time deepfake detection system that leverages computer vision and audio analysis to identify manipulated media during streaming or upload processes. By combining deep neural networks with efficient processing pipelines, the system provides enterprise-grade detection with minimal latency.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of deepfake technology represents a significant threat to information integrity and public trust. As AI-generated synthetic media becomes increasingly sophisticated, traditional detection methods that rely on offline processing or simple visual cues are rapidly becoming insufficient. Content platforms, news organizations, and security services require real-time deepfake detection capabilities to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect digital authenticity.
